Here we have a summary of entire human history of CPU progress, like a in museum.

Intel:
486
Pentium 1
Pentium 1-MMX
Pentium II
Pentium III
Pentium 4
Pentium M (Centrino)
Core 1 Duo *missing piece from my collection... the missing link between the older Pentium III / M and Core 2 Duo.
Core 2 Duo
---
Core i7 870  - 1st gen 
Core i7 2600 - 2nd gen <-- here we have a massive drop in optimized ratio. Why ? Because the base score is 
Core i7 3770 - 3rd gen *very similar to 2nd gen; missing.
Core i7 4770 - 4th gen
Core i7 5600U- 5th gen *missing from the hi-end desktop lineup; mostly mobile generation for laptops.
Core i7 6700 - 6th gen
Core i7 7700 - 7th gen
Core i7 8700 - 8th gen
Core i9 9900K- 9th gen
Core i9 10900K- 10th gen
Core i9 11900K- 11th gen
Core i9 12900K- 12th gen


Curious:
Core i7 870  - 1st gen 
Core i7 2600 - 2nd gen <-- here we have a massive drop in optimized ratio. 
Why ? Because the base score is so much higher. Basically it can predict
*and* execute speculative code so much better, that it is less dependent on code optimizations.
Meaning that

Intel Xeons are based on core-i7 design, either directly or indirectly.

Where is Core i7 5700 ? missing ... because 14nm factory was delayed, and so intel decided to skip
and went to 6th gen on the desktop.
