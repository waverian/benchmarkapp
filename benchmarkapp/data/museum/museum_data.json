            "historical note:": "One of the biggest generations ever made by Intel in terms of new features & instructions.\n2nd biggest only to AMD Athlon 64 -- invention of x86-64 architecture itself !\nIt has added AVX2, BMI, HLE , RTM, FMA3, MOVBE, zero-latency register moves,\nand more.\n\nHLE - Hardware Lock Elision, a backward compatible set of prefixes that can be applied to instructions such as LOCK CMPXCHG to minimize lock overhead under low contention\nRTM - Restricted Transactional Memory, the feature I've anticipated the most, the ability to atomically roll back a block of code or atomically commit a block of code\nBMI - Bit Manipulation Instructions, this is a set of about a dozen new 32-bit and 64-bit integer operations designed to perform Hacker's Delight type of bit manipulation instructions, bitfield operations, and flag-less shifts and multiplies.  These are designed to accelerate encryption and handling of non-byte aligned data, such as processing bit vectors, decoding instructions, or performing bitfield moves.\nAVX2 - what SSE2 was to SSE, AVX2 is to AVX, adding 256-bit packed integer operations to the AVX instruction set\nFMA3 - Fused-Multiply-Add support permits common floating operations such as dot product and matrix multiply to execute multiply+add in one instruction\na 4th ALU - up to 4 integer ALU operations can retire per clock cycle, leading to peak integer performance of over 14000 MIPS per core, definitely something that helps legacy code\nMOVBE - Move Big Endian load/store support, previously only available on the Atom, specifically helps to accelerate simulators of big endian machines such as 68040 and PowerPC.\nzero-latency register moves - common register-to-register move operations are handled by the register renamer instead of wasting an ALU operation, speeding up register calling convention\n\nRead \"Haswell's great leap forward\":\nhttp://emulators.com/docs/nx36_haswell_262.htm"
