These are designed to accelerate encryption and handling of non-byte aligned data, such as processing bit vectors, decoding instructions, or performing bitfield moves.\nAVX2 - what SSE2 was to SSE, AVX2 is to AVX, adding 256-bit packed integer operations to the AVX instruction set\nFMA3 - Fused-Multiply-Add support permits common floating operations such as dot product and matrix multiply to execute multiply+add in one instruction\na 4th ALU - up to 4 integer ALU operations can retire per clock cycle, leading to peak integer performance of over 14000 MIPS per core, definitely something that helps legacy code\nMOVBE - Move Big Endian load/store support, previously only available on the Atom, specifically helps to accelerate simulators of big endian machines such as 68040 and PowerPC.\nzero-latency register moves - common register-to-register move operations are handled by the register renamer instead of wasting an ALU operation, speeding up register calling convention\n\nRead \"Haswell's great leap forward\":\nhttp://emulators.com/docs/nx36_haswell_262.htm\n"
