Historic note:
Processor for Pentium socket. MMX Technology. AMD's answer to the Intel Pentium Processor.
AMD's first super-scalar and out-of-order design, acquired from NetGen (their Nx686 design).
Super-scalar meaning it can execute more than 1 commands per clock cycle.
Out-of-order meaning it can re-order instructions on the fly, provided it does not change the algorithm's logic.
