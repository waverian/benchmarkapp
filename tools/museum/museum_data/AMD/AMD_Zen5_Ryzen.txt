Historic note:
Zen 5 is a slightly faster version of Zen 4.
AMD says it is a new architecture with +50% wider issue and more pipelines,
but the benchmarks suggets there are major bottlenecks with this new architecture,
making effective performance similar to that of the Zen 4.
TDP by default is still too high, at 230 Watts. Can be cured via BIOS under-clocking / Eco-mode. Overall it feels like a minor refresh of the previous-gen 7000-series.
No major performance boost in ST, and not in MT either.
