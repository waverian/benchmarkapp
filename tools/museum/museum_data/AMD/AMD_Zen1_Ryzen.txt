Historic note:
This CPU was revolutionary, because 1st time in many decades AMD was able to out-perform Intel, at least in
multi-threaded workloads. (Intel's competitor in summer-2017 was Core i7 7700K, which offered only 4 cores.)
Addionally AMD has released AMD Threadripper 1950X Workstaion-class CPU, with 16 cores, to compete against 
Core iX and Xeon workstations.
---
Intel at the time was sleeping for a decade from 2007 to 2017 only offering 4-cores in it's desktop offerings 
(Core 2 Quad to Core i7-7700K),
and another half a decade sleeping on it's laurels on re-releasing it's good, but aging Skylake architecture (2015-2021).
Someone had to wake up Intel. Be it AMD, Apple, or maybe a bunch of ARM CPU vendors.
