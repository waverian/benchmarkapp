Historic note:
Intel 486 socket-compatible processor. Doubled cache memory.
This CPU introduces the so-called "Pentium Rating" PR-75 indicates that this 133 MHz chip can compete against Intel Pentium 75 MHz.
Basically a fast version of the 486 architecture, marketed as a competitor to the Intel's Pentium, a true 586 chip.
A true 586-class chip must include:
1. a much faster internal data bus (66 MHz vs 33 MHz on the 486), 
2. faster memory (EDO RAM vs FPM RAM)
3. faster device bus (PCI vs ISA)
4. L1 cache must be devided into separate instructions + data. (otherwise there is high latency)
AMD Am5x86 fails on all 4 of those points.
Therefore we can conclude that the AMD Am5x86 is really a 486 architecture inside, repainted as new.
