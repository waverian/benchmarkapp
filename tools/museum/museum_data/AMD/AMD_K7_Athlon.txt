Historic note:
AMD's answer to the Intel Pentium III ! Amazing processor, and 1st time in history, 
when AMD was able to defeat Intel on architecture and performance.
Huge L1 cache at the time.
(2nd time was during AMD Zen 2 architecture, in 2019, which is 20 years later!)
AMD Athlon was the world's first processor to reach 1 GHz, costs $1299 upon release (Mar.2000).
