Historic note:
Bulldozer. a.k.a. "Foofix" by the people.
This CPU is interesting, because it was unique in a way where it was built from 4 modules of 2 cores each.
This is theoretically better than hyper-threadring, because each core has it's own execution units and L1 cache, with only the FPU being shared.
This CPU closed the gap with Intel when it comes to different supported instructions, adding support for SSE4.2 and AVX technology.
Ultimately what killed this generation is ultra-slow single-core performance which was in many ways even slower than AMD's own previous-gen Phenom II processors, and it had no chance at all vs newer Intel Core i7-2600 "Sandy Bridge" series.
