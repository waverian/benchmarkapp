Historic note:
Zen 4 is a totally new Architecture by AMD; Added AVX512 instructions + an iGPU,
which is really useful for Office computers, and avoids buying a video card, saving money.
Also adds an RDNA2 GPU with AV1 video decoder, another very useful feature for office PC.
As for CPU performance, it does significantly out-perform the previous Zen3, by like 20-25%
in many ST and MT workloads, even at the same TDP levels.
AMD has migrated to a 5 nm technology node and to DDR5 memory with this generation.
Also doubling the RAM to 256 GB on the desktop, from 128 GB on AM4 systems. (ZEN1/2/3)
On the downside, by default Zen4 consumes too much power, making the system too noisy with
an average cooler, forcing people to use Eco-mode in BIOS to push TDP downwards.
