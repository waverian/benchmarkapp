Introduced: 2001
Generation of AMD Architecture : 7.5
Example: AMD Athlon XP 1800+ @ 1533 MHz
Architecture / Codename: K7, Athlon XP, "Palomino", "Thoroughbred", "Barton"
KEYWORD_CPU_ARCH_ID: AMD_ATHLONXP
Cores / Threads: 1
Technology node: 180 nm, 130 nm
Die Size: 150 mmÂ² (?)
Transistors: 37 million
Frequency: 1000-2200 MHz
Instructions: x86. MMX. 3Dnow!, SSE
TDP: ~65 watt
Cache L1: 64 KB = 32 KB + 32 KB (i+d)
Cache L2: 256 KB, L2 cache works CPU speed.
Cache L3: -
Cache Total (ex.L1): -
Memory type: SDRAM-100/133 MHz
Memory bandwidth: ~1.0 GB/s
Memory Size, Typical: 128-256 MB
Memory Size, Max: -
Historic note:
AMD Athlon XP added SSE instructions for 3D games, and increased clock speeds.
"XP" officially stands for "eXtended Performance", and unofficially for "Windows XP",
a Microsoft operating system released in the same time in 2001. Both work together beautifully.

During this time Ethernet-on-motherboard and Sound-on-motherboard became common.
An amazing example is GIGABYTE GA7VRXP board that integrates both sound, LAN and RAID controller on-board !
This was unheard of during the 1990's, on desktop computers.
The +15 million transistors came from the on-chip L2 cache of 256 KB size.
Otherwise the core itself is similar, and should be 22 million transistors.
