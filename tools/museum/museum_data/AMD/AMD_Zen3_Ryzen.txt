Historic note:
Zen 3 is really a much-faster, desktop-optmized, refined architecture delivered from Zen 2.
Zen 3 is only slightly faster in multi-core (10%), but significantly faster in single-core (20%).
Zen 3 can utilize almost all the execution engines from a single-core apps, while Zen 2 under-utilized those,
so to extract max performance from zen 2, it was necessary to write multi-threaded code.
You can view Zen 3 as a Gamer's CPU, where AMD Ryzen 5000 series finally closed the gap against Intel's Core i9 9900K CPU
when it comes to gaming, and it performs much faster in workstation-class apps, due to 2x more cores.
