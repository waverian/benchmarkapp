Memory type: LPDDR5
Memory bandwidth: 102.4 GB/s; (up to 819.2 GB/s for M2 Ultra)
Memory Size, Max: 24 GB (up to 192 GB for M2 Ultra)
Historical note:
The M3 is Apple's first chip to be built on a 3 nm process; 
includes a totally new Apple-designed GPU + a new video media engine, built from the ground up.
Supports mesh shaders, ray-tracing, and AV1 video decoder.
The GPU part shares a lot of common with the Apple A17 Pro chips.
The CPU part is similar to the M1 and M2 chips, without much modifications, but clocked faster.

Variants:
A17 Pro - 6 cores (2P+4e); 5-6 GPU cores; mem.bandwidth = 51.2 GB/sec; 19 billion transistors
M3 - 8 cores (4P+4e); 8-10 GPU cores; mem.bandwidth = 102.4 GB/sec; 25 billion transistors
M3 Pro - 12 cores (6P+6e); 14-18 GPU cores; mem.bandwidth = 153.6 GB/sec; 37 billion transistors
M3 Max - 16 cores (12P+4e); 30-40 GPU cores; mem.bandwidth = 409.6 GB/sec; 92 billion transistors
