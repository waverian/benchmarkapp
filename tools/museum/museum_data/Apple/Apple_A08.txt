Historical note:
This CPU was so fast that it was coming close to Intel Core 2 Duo processors from year 2006.
Core 2 Duo, even in 2014, had enough performance oomph to push most common desktop workloads, websites, and video.
At this generation I figured out, that it may be possible to build a desktop PC using mobile chips from an iPhone, and expect relatively 'okay-ish' performance for office and web tasks.
This dream came true with the Apple M1 triumph in 2020, 6 years later!
Apple A8X, a variant with triple-core design was used in iPad Air 2.
