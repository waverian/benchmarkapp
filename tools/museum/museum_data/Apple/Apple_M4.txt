Historical note:
The M4 a huge upgrade by Apple. A mega-revolution.
Ground-breaking performance.
It has a completely new CPU architecture, much wider issue, with a new instruction decoder.
Much improved branch prediction and intructions per clock (IPC) cycle.
IPC is increased by about +15% vs the M3, and together with +10% clock, it delivers +25% 
performance on single-core, beating everyone and anything at single-core.
It is even beating top-end desktops AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, 9950X, 
  and Intel Core i9-14900K at many single-core benchmarks, and web browsing !
All of this while being passively cooled and completely silent on the iPad, in a 5-mm thin body.
Totally ridiculous performance, that is unheard of ! 
A 15-watt device beating a 300-watt, water-cooled, fastest desktop CPU (Intel's 14900K) !

Variants:
A18 - 6 cores (2P+4e); 5-6 GPU cores; mem.bandwidth = ? GB/sec; ? billion transistors
M4 - 10 cores (4P+10e); 10 GPU cores; mem.bandwidth = 120 GB/sec; 28 billion transistors
