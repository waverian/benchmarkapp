Historical note:
This is the moment ! On this CPU, the 1st Apple desktops were based.
The Apple M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max and M1 Ultra are all based on this design of the A14.
Same 5nm tech node, same CPU and GPU cores.
A14 is also significantly faster than anyone before it, approaching desktop-level
of Performance for web browsing and other office work tasks.
