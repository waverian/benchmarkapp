Historical note:
This is the historic moment ! Apple's 1st desktop CPU ! The M1 !
Built on the same Apple A14 Performance-cores (Firestorm), it took the world by storm !
It beats the competition both on single-thread performance as well as 
performance per watt. Two very important metrics.
Energy-efficient cores (E-cores) are based on "Icestorm" microarchitecture.
First time in the world one can build a very thin laptop, 
that works 15 hours on a battery,
and delivers amazing Core i7-like performance levels and is completely silent !
Such a combination has NEVER existed before and was considered impossible until now !
Welcome to the ZERO noise computing ! Macbook Air M1, 2020 !
Probably the most unique and most amazing laptop ever built.
(despite it's lack of I/O, but that is a story for another day...)
Later variants include The M1 Pro, M1 Max and M1 Ultra as it's big brothers.

Variants:
A14 - 6 cores (2P+4e); 4 GPU cores; mem.bandwidth = 34.1 GB/sec; 11.8 billion transistors
M1 - 8 cores (4P+4e); 7-8 GPU cores; mem.bandwidth = 68.3 GB/sec; 16 billion transistors
M1 Pro - 10 cores (8P+2e); 14-16 GPU cores; mem.bandwidth = 204.8 GB/sec; 33.7 billion transistors
M1 Max - 10 cores (8P+2e); 24-32 GPU cores; mem.bandwidth = 409.6 GB/sec; 57 billion transistors
M1 Ultra - 20 cores (16P+4e); 48-64 GPU cores; mem.bandwidth = 819.2 GB/sec; 114 billion transistors
