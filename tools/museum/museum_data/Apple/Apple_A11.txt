Historical note:
Named "Bionic" because it was the first Apple chip to introduce an NPU -- Neural Processing Unit.
Very much like biological brain, it can model neurons and their connections to identify images,
Face ID, and maybe even play Chess... :)
Until now, Apple chips included only CPUs and GPUs (besides memory and I/O units).
