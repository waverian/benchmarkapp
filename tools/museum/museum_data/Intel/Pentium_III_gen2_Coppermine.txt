Historical note:
Pentium III "Coppermine" converts the slot-based into socket-based system. 
Plus adds 256 KB of L2-cache at full CPU speed. And bus speed upgrade to 133 MHz.
Also shrinks the node process from 250 to 180 nm, doubling the performance.
transistor count tripled due to the on-chip L2 cache.
