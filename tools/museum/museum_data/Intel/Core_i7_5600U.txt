Historic note:
Broadwell was an evolution of Haswell. Moved to 14nm node process. Added ADX (arbitrary-precision integer),
 RDSEED (a new random number generator for improved security & encryption).
Note, that this generation never offered top-of-the-line desktop & gaming PC, something like the hypothetical Core i7-5700K.
This generation was mostly successful at mobile (notebook & laptop) markets with the Core i7 5600U,
and server market with Xeon E5 v4 family.
