Historical note:
Nehalem. The next-gen of Intel Architecture.
First Intel processor to integrate memory-controller on die, in the CPU itself, rather than in chipset.
Adds SSE4.2 instructions and VT-x Nested Page Tables (aka VT-x 2.0) -- much faster virtualization.
First CPU based to Intel Core to re-add the previously lost during Core 2 Duo era of "Hyper-Threading" technology.
First CPU to feature both quad-core and 8-threads ! It was a whopping *huge* deal back in 2008 !
First CPU to make DDR3 memory the common standard ! (most of previous-gen Core 2 Duos were running on DDR2)
Bloomfield has a triple-channel memory controller vs. a dual-channel memory for Lynnfield.
Performance for most applications is comparable.
