Historical note:
the Pentium II. Revolutionary P6 architecture.
Super-scalar with multiple execution units, branch prediction and micro-code
to transform x86 to internal machine-code.
Much faster than the original Pentium, clock-for-clock on 32-bit code execution.
Speculative execution and out-of-order completion.
All modern processors are essentially based on this concept, so we can call all
modern CPUs as a Pentium II-descendats of sorts, at least in idea.
L2 cache works at half the CPU speed, so a 400 MHz chip had only a 200 MHz L2 cache.
L1 cache always works at full CPU speed, for all models.

Variants:
Celeron, based on the Pentium II, had no L2 cache at all for early models, and only 128 KB
for later models; while Server-based Pentium II Xeon chips have had 1 MB or 2 MB full-speed L2.
