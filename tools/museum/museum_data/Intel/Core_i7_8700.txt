Historical note:
After failing to intoduce 10nm process in 2016, as planned by Intel's Tick/Tock plan, Intel got stuck with Skylake 14-nm variants for many years...
Same eggs, a different busket.
But this generation Intel decided to upgrade core count from 4 to 6, pushing performance upwards.
(also upping mobile U-variants from 2 to 4 cores. U stands for "Ultrabook")
