Historical note:
Pentium M is an alternative upgrade-path as the next-gen of Intel Architecture, instead of the Pentium 4.
Based on the Pentium III, it extends the arch with new instructions (SSE2),
new bus, improved branch prediction and bigger L1+ L2 caches.
Basically this works as a much improved Pentium III, 
without the power-hungry problems of the Pentium 4.

It was sold mostly on laptops, marketed as an "Intel Centrino" platforms, together with a Wi-Fi chip !
Until 2003 "Centrino", most of the laptops had no Wi-Fi chip and were connected to the Internet via wired LAN RJ-45 Ethernet cable.

Basically during this age, laptops were using the Pentium M "Centrino", while desktops were using the "Pentium 4".
Totally different chips with totally different architecture and characteristics.

Compared to the Pentium 4, the Pentium M had no hyper-threading, had a much lower clock-speed, but much higher IPC (instructions-per-clock), and better power efficienty (amount of work per watt of power).
Pentium M achieved similar performance to the Pentium 4, in some workloads even out-performing it, while using only 1/3rd of the power !
At this point it became obvious, that the Pentium 4 is hitting a dead-end, and must be replaced, even on the desktop !

Pentium M, like the previous Pentium III were single-core, single-threaded design running 32-bit x86 code.

Variants:
Dothan is a 2nd-gen Pentium M, doubles transistors and L2 cache, and reduces node to 90 nm, introduced in 2004.
