Historical note:
This CPU was so much faster than Nehalem, and Intel progress were to slow down for the next-decade
 so much so that people who bought this CPU made the purchase-of-the-decade !
Meaning buying one computer and no need to upgrade for a decade, because it's performance was still adequate for tasks a decade later in 2021 !
This was unheard of for people in the 90's,
when people were getting +300% performance boost was common every 3-4 years !
