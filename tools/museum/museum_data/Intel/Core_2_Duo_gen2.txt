Historical note:
Wolfdale. An improved Conroe.
Much smaller process node leads to a much smaller die size.
Intel decided to increase cache size from 4 MB to 6 MB. By +50%.
Intel also improved branch prediction, added a Radix-16 divider, 
improving performance and introduced SSE 4.1 new instructions.

Variants:
Core 2 Quad Q8000/ Q9000 series "Yorkfield" have 4-cores. Double the cores, transistors and the TDP to 130 Watts.
Some models have halved L2 cache, and/or disabled VT-x virtualization.
