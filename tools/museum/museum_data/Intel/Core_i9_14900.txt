Historical note:
14th gen is a minor refresh over 13th gen. Slightly higher clock speeds.
Architecture and process node are identical.
Back in the 1990's in the Pentium-1-era it would be just "hidden" refresh,
or a "minor chip revision", not even called a next-generation core.
But it's not just a 14th Gen Intel Core, but also a 14th-gen,
real Intel Architecture if counted since 8086, according to our view.
Making the chip at >300 watts TDP is little short of insane,
the TDPs has to go way way lower, probably under 100 watts by default,
including Turbo boost, and leave higher wattage exploration for over-clockers.
This TDP may causes both long-term instability *and* also noisy cooling for most average coolers.
This chip is essentially the equivalent of a factory-overclocked chip. (both the i7 and the i9)
Core i3 and i5 have more sane defaults, but still a far cry from Apple M4's 20 watts of TDP,
which is optimal for desktop users in our view.
