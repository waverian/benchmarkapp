Historical note:
Conroe. The next-gen of Intel Architecture. 
First Intel processor to fix the short-comings of an ultra-long Pentium 4 pipeline.
this pipeline was both slow for many workloads, and power-hungry.
This is a evolution of the Pentium III (and Pentium M), while discardind the Pentium 4
architecture.

Variants:
Core 2 Quad Q6000 series "Kentsfield" have 4-cores. Double the cores, transistors and the TDP to 130 Watts.
Some models have halved L2 cache, and/or disabled VT-x virtualization.
