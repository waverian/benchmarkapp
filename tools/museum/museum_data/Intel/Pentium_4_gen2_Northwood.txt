Technology node: 130 nm
Die Size: 131 mm^2
Transistors: 55 million
Frequency: 1600-3400 MHz
Instructions: x86, MMX, SSE, SSE2
TDP: ~35-110 Watts
Socket: Socket 478
Cache L1 (instructions / data): 8 KB / 8 KB (8 KB for micro-instructions t-cache)
Cache L2: 512 KB
Cache L3: -
Memory type: SDRAM/DDR1/DDR2/RDRAM
Memory bandwidth: varied.
Memory Size, Max: 4 GB (64 GB with PAE mode)
Memory Size, Typical: 128-512 MB (typically with a much cheaper DDR1 SDRAM)
Historical note:
Northwood was a 2nd-gen Pentium 4, upgrading sockets, and doubling the L2 cache to 512 KB,
tech node from 180 to 130 nm, and improving clock rate and performance significantly.
Some models even support Hyper-threading, allowind for 2 threads on a single-core.
The idea is that for a +5% transistor budget, it is possible to get a +30% performance in some applications.
Increased transistor budget from 42 to 55 million comes mainly from the doubling of L2 cache.
