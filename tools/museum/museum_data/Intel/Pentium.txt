Memory bandwidth: 
Memory Size, Typical: 8-16 MB

Historical note:
5th gen Intel architecture. Pentium era.
First Super-scalar architecture, when a CPU can execute up-to 2 cycles per second,
assuming they don't have dependency on each other. The CPU decoder and issuer
can dispatch and execute commands in parallel.

While other vendors could copy and clone Intel 386/486 chips due to Intel agreement with IBM, nobody 
could clone the Pentium, meaning that the competition had to develop a new architecture from the ground-up.

Variants:
Pentium 66-200 MHz.
